# Space2Stats Python Client

A Python client for accessing the Space2Stats API, providing easy access to consistent, comparable, and authoritative sub-national variation data from the World Bank.


## API Methods

### `get_topics()`
Returns a DataFrame containing available dataset themes/topics from the STAC catalog.

---

### `get_fields()`
Returns a list of all available fields that can be used with the API.

---

### `get_properties(item_id: str)`
Returns a DataFrame with descriptions of variables for a specific dataset.

---

### `fetch_admin_boundaries(iso3: str, adm: str)`
Fetches administrative boundaries from GeoBoundaries API for a given country and admin level.

---

### `get_summary(gdf, spatial_join_method, fields, geometry=None)`
Extracts H3 level data for areas of interest.
- **Parameters:**
  - `gdf`: GeoDataFrame containing areas of interest
  - `spatial_join_method`: "touches", "centroid", or "within"
  - `fields`: List of field names to retrieve
  - `geometry`: Optional "polygon" or "point" to include H3 geometries

---

### `get_aggregate(gdf, spatial_join_method, fields, aggregation_type)`
Extracts summary statistics from H3 data.
- **Parameters:**
  - `gdf`: GeoDataFrame containing areas of interest
  - `spatial_join_method`: "touches", "centroid", or "within"
  - `fields`: List of field names to retrieve
  - `aggregation_type`: "sum", "avg", "count", "max", or "min"

---

### `get_summary_by_hexids(hex_ids, fields, geometry)`
Retrieves statistics for specific H3 hexagon IDs.
- **Parameters:**
  - `hex_ids`: List of H3 hexagon IDs to query
  - `fields`: List of field names to retrieve
  - `geometry`: Optional; specifies if H3 geometries should be included ("polygon" or "point")

---

### `get_aggregate_by_hexids(hex_ids, fields, aggregation_type)`
Aggregates statistics for specific H3 hexagon IDs.
- **Parameters:**
  - `hex_ids`: List of H3 hexagon IDs to aggregate
  - `fields`: List of field names to aggregate
  - `aggregation_type`: Type of aggregation ("sum", "avg", "count", "max", "min")

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install space2stats-client
```

```python
from space2stats_client import Space2StatsClient
import geopandas as gpd

# Initialize the client
client = Space2StatsClient()

# Get available topics/datasets
topics = client.get_topics()
print(topics)

# Get fields for a specific dataset
fields = client.get_fields("dataset_id")
print(fields)

# Get data for an area of interest
gdf = gpd.read_file("path/to/your/area.geojson")
summary = client.get_summary(
    gdf=gdf,
    spatial_join_method="centroid",
    fields=["population", "gdp"]
)

# Get aggregated statistics
aggregates = client.get_aggregate(
    gdf=gdf,
    spatial_join_method="centroid",
    fields=["population", "gdp"],
    aggregation_type="sum"
)
```
