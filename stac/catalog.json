  "description": "This database contains geospatial statistics for the entire globe standardized to a hexagonal grid. The spatial unit of the dataset is the H3 level 6 (approximately 36 sq. km. per cell). The variables cover a wide range of geographic themes relevant to international development, including demographic, socio-economic, environmental, climate, and infrastructure. An API enables users to query, access, and aggregate statistics from the Space2Stats database. The purpose of this API is to facilitate the generation of sub-national geospatial aggregates for any administrative boundary set.",
