# Space2Stats
The Space2Stats program is designed to provide academics, statisticians, and other interested data scientists with easier access to regularly requested geospatial aggregate data. The primary deliverable is a database of geospatial aggregates at two official scales:
1. Official World Bank boundaries at admin level 2  
2. A global database of h3 hexagons at level 6 (~36km2)  

The Space2Stats program is funded by the World Bank's [Global Data Facility](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/global-data-facility), which is a World-Bank hosted global funding instrument for the world's most critical data impact opportunities.
