# Space2Stats

Consistent, comparable, authoritative data describing sub-national variation is a constant point of complication for World Bank teams, our development partners, and client countries when assessing and investigating economic issues and national policy. This project will focus on creating and disseminating such data through aggregation of geospatial information at standard administrative divisions, and through the attribution of household survey data with foundational geospatial variables.

All details and instructions on using the database can be found on our Github Pages - https://worldbank.github.io/DECAT_Space2Stats/readme.html

## Getting Started Locally
Details on running a local database can be found in the dev-db folder of this repo
