[For complete project information, please click here](https://worldbank.github.io/GEEST/README.html)

With support from the [Canada Clean Energy and Forest Climate Facility (CCEFCFy)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/climatechange/brief/canada-world-bank-clean-energy-and-forests-climate-facility), the [Geospatial Operational Support Team (GOST, DECSC)](https://worldbank.github.io/GOST) launched the project "Geospatial Assessment of Women Employment and Business Opportunities in the Renewable Energy Sector." The project proposes a novel methodology for mapping the enabling environments for women's employmenty. The goal is to inform new energy projects in client countries to support the advancement of women's economic empowerment while contributing to closing gender gaps in employment in the RE sector.

In addition to the methodology, the project has generated an geospatial open-source, QGIS tool for implementing the methodology. For more details, visit the GEEST project directly.
